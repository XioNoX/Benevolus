<h4>The PHP Fat-Free Framework</h4>
<p><b>Fat-Free</b> is a powerful yet lightweight PHP 5.3+ Web development framework designed to help you build dynamic and robust applications - fast!</p>
<p><b>Condensed in a single 55KB file</b>, the framework's simple domain-specific language gives you access to Fat-Free's all-purpose template engine, powerful cache, automatic spam protection, unit testing tools, code profiler, HTML forms processor, plus an easy-to-use SQL handler for fine-tuning database engine interactions. It's so small and fast; it even has a way of controlling Web server traffic - the only framework that shields you from brute force and Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks.</p>
<p>Fat-Free is also packaged with <b>optional plug-ins</b> that include the auto-mapping Axon ORM, M2 MongoDB mapper, CAPTCHA image generator, Javascript/CSS compressor, dynamic XML sitemaps, thumbnail and fake image generator, identicons, user authentication, custom logger, tools for communicating with other servers and handling ZIP archives, as well as API wrappers for Google, Twitter, Yahoo! and Akismet. There's also an i18n  extension to help you write multilingual applications.</p>
<p>The philosophy behind the framework and its approach to the Model-View-Controller design pattern is towards minimalism in structural components, avoiding application complexity and striking a balance between code elegance, application performance and programmer productivity.</p>
<p><b>Unlike other PHP frameworks, Fat-Free aims to be usable - not usual.</b></p>

<h4>This Demo</h4>
<p>This demo should give you an idea of how easy it is to design and write an MVC-based application using Fat-Free. Please refer to the <a href="http://fatfree.sourceforge.net" onclick="{@extlink}">documentation</a>, this blog's source code, import files and associated HTML templates for more information. The files contain a lot of inline documentation to help you understand how the application works and how the code interacts with the framework.</p>
<p>Fat-Free runs seamlessly with any Javascript toolkit/library (JQuery, MooTools, Script.aculo.us, Dojo, Prototype, YUI, or what have you).</p>
